Right click anywhere for the context menu or use the burger icon (hidden when Streamdog is not focused).

Streamdog is fully customizable by editing the png files in the skins folder.
To create a new skin, simply create a new foler and edit/replace the png files.
The GIMP source files (.xcf) are included for easier editing, but feel free to use your favorite image editing tools.

You can also drag and drop GIFs and other images directly in the window and move them around.
The layout is saved automatically for next time you use Streamdog.


Thanks for using Streamdog and for your support!
